It is also a more grand plan of [[Dollar Cost Averaging]] and staking dividend stocks. The DCA is funded by a pre-determined portion of the employee's salary and investing it into a myriad of funds and assets that will be invested in intervals regardless of price of equity. Although it [[Fundemental Analysis is essential prior to any technical analysis or strategy formulation]], 401Ks/Roth IRAs are [[DCAs remove market psychology from investment portfolios]] and therefore, [[DCAs work when asset prices increase over time]].

Warmuth\nTags: \nYear: 2021\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01493\nZotero URL: zotero://select/items/@majidiExponentiatedGradientReweighting2021\nCitekey: majidiExponentiatedGradientReweighting2021\n\nMany learning tasks in machine learning can be viewed as taking a gradient step towards minimizing the average loss of a batch of examples in each training iteration. When noise is prevalent in the data, this uniform treatment of examples can lead to overfitting to noisy examples with larger loss values and result in poor generalization. Inspired by the expert setting in on-line learning, we present a flexible approach to learning from noisy examples. Specifically, we treat each training example as an expert and maintain a distribution over all examples. We alternate between updating the parameters of the model using gradient descent and updating the example weights using the exponentiated gradient update. Unlike other related methods, our approach handles a general class of loss functions and can be applied to a wide range of noise types and applications. We show the efficacy of our approach for multiple learning settings, namely noisy principal component analysis and a variety of noisy classification problems.","lastmodified":"2022-04-07T19:23:03.027038983Z","tags":null},"/notes/Five-ideas-to-GTD":{"title":"Five ideas to GTD","content":"---\n# Five ideas to GTD\n\n1.  Getting things done requires defining what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means and what ‚Äúdoing‚Äù looks like.\n\t1. **Outcome.** Defining what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means\n\t2.  **Action.** What ‚Äúdoing‚Äù looks like\n2.  Mastering your workflow involves capturing what has your attention, clarifying what it means, putting it where it belongs, reviewing it frequently, and engaging with it.\n\t1.  **Capture.** Collect what has your attention\n\t\t1.  Every open loop must be in your capture system and out of your head\n\t\t2.  You must have as few capturing buckets as you can get by with\n\t\t3.  You must empty them regularly\t\n\t2.  **Clarify.** Process what it means\n\t3.  **Organize.** Put it where it belongs\n\t4.  **Reflect.** Review frequently\n\t5.  **Engage.** Simply do.\n3.  If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined.\n\t1.  **Do it.** If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined.\n\t2.  **Delegate it.** If the action will take longer than two minutes, ask yourself, ‚ÄúAm I the right person to do this?‚Äù If the answer is no, delegate it to the appropriate entity.\n\t3.  **Defer it.** If the action will take longer than two minutes, and you _are_ the right person to do it, you will have to defer acting on it until later and track it on one or more ‚ÄúNext Actions‚Äù lists.\n\t- Allen defines a project as any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step.\n4.  Anxiety and guilt don‚Äôt come from having too much to do; it comes from breaking agreements with yourself.\n\t- No-action systems fall into three categories:\n\t1. **Trash.** This is self-evident.\n\t2. **Incubation.** These are things that require no immediate action but are worth keeping. There are two kinds of incubation tools (i) Someday/Maybe lists and (ii) a tickler system. Someday/Maybe items are of the nature of ‚Äúprojects I might want to do, but not now ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd like to be reminded of them regularly.‚Äù A tickler system is for items that you don‚Äôt want or need to be reminded of until some designated time in the future.\n\t3. **Reference.** Reference systems generally take two forms: (1) topic- and area-specific storage, and (2) general reference files. The first types usually define themselves in terms of how they are stored. The second type of reference system is one that everyone needs close at hand for storing ad hoc information that doesn‚Äôt belong in some predesigned larger category.\n\t-  ‚ÄúAll of your Projects, active project plans, and Next Actions, Agendas, Waiting For, and even Someday/Maybe lists should be reviewed once a week.‚Äù\n5.  Your mind is for having ideas, not for holding them.","lastmodified":"2022-04-07T19:23:03.027038983Z","tags":null},"/notes/showcase":{"title":"Showcase","content":"Want to see what Quartz can do?
