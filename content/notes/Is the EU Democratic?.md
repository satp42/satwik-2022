This is a blog post I wrote when I was in 7th grade on my first website. It was analysis of a video I watched called ["Is the EU Democratic? Does Your Vote Matter?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uu5eyN6VU)

Being a European has its idiosyncrasies. For one, every executive action seems as if it is being enforced by mysterious entities. It feels as if a huge bureaucracy is making decisions over our heads. Many Europeans are starting to express their beliefs on the EU’s governmental system, mostly focusing on the question: Is the EU democratic, and is does the Europeans’ votes achieve anything.

In democratic states, public policy is based on individualized beliefs. Therefore, decisions entail people to compromise and the will of the people. However, people are not necessarily coherent. Countless different parties are trying to battle for authority, thus they can produce legislation that indulges themselves. In a working democracy, there is an elaborate system of checks and balances, that enables such battles to be carried out in a civilized matter. For example, term limits restrict factions from dominating too much. But all this ends at our borders. Foreign policy is not democratic, rather it is anarchic. No central authority is strong enough to regulate, therefore the only international law is the tyranny of the strongest and anarchy. So for most of human history, strong countries took what they needed (wanted) through extortion or by violence.

By WWII, the UN (United Nations) was established to regulate international politics. But since the UN has virtually no power, and members typically have differing interests, no one really complies.

The EU (European Union) is a construct that tries to have rules and laws for its member nations (pretty much all of the nations in Europe) that are actually enforceable, as the European Court of Justices has the right to make binding decisions. Originally, the EU was a union to maintain diplomatic relations within all rule-abiding members. However, it was also established to prosper all the members/countries through diplomatic force. You can consider the EU as a “superstate.” To prosper as a union, however, you must solve various predicaments in most of the states. This was a dilemma because the states have plenty of different priorities.

In order for a democratic union, the EU had to establish the framework of their union. First, representation was necessitated. The EU had two pathways: 1) Each country elects representatives to represent and execute actions with the other country’s representatives. 2) Everyone votes for an independent institution that executes binding decisions. In the end, the EU mixed both frameworks.

Next, the European Court of Justice was needed to be established. The court consists of the European Council, which contains the heads of all member states, the Council of the EU, which consists of ministers, the EU Commission, the institution with one commissioner per state, and the EU Parliament, the only department with elected officials. By principle, all diplomats in each of these departments originate from the direct or indirect vote of the people from a domestic or national perspective, however, some do more than others. For example, your direct vote influences who is in office for a nation, but it also influences who will be in the European Council. These leaders then choose who will be the president of the EU Commission and other fellow commissioners, who are then validated by the EU Parliamentarians.

To sum this all up, the answer to the overarching question is that, indeed, the EU is a democratic union, but in an indirect matter. The framework leads to many officials being elected through the first direct vote. Therefore, as a European citizen, you do in fact, have a say in the European political system.
