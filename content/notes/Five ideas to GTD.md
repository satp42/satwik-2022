# Five ideas to GTD

1.  Getting things done requires defining what “done” means and what “doing” looks like.
	1. **Outcome.** Defining what “done” means
	2.  **Action.** What “doing” looks like
2.  Mastering your workflow involves capturing what has your attention, clarifying what it means, putting it where it belongs, reviewing it frequently, and engaging with it.
	1.  **Capture.** Collect what has your attention
		1.  Every open loop must be in your capture system and out of your head
		2.  You must have as few capturing buckets as you can get by with
		3.  You must empty them regularly	
	2.  **Clarify.** Process what it means
	3.  **Organize.** Put it where it belongs
	4.  **Reflect.** Review frequently
	5.  **Engage.** Simply do.
3.  If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined.
	1.  **Do it.** If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined.
	2.  **Delegate it.** If the action will take longer than two minutes, ask yourself, “Am I the right person to do this?” If the answer is no, delegate it to the appropriate entity.
	3.  **Defer it.** If the action will take longer than two minutes, and you _are_ the right person to do it, you will have to defer acting on it until later and track it on one or more “Next Actions” lists.
	- Allen defines a project as any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step.
4.  Anxiety and guilt don’t come from having too much to do; it comes from breaking agreements with yourself.
	- No-action systems fall into three categories:
	1. **Trash.** This is self-evident.
	2. **Incubation.** These are things that require no immediate action but are worth keeping. There are two kinds of incubation tools (i) Someday/Maybe lists and (ii) a tickler system. Someday/Maybe items are of the nature of “projects I might want to do, but not now … but I’d like to be reminded of them regularly.” A tickler system is for items that you don’t want or need to be reminded of until some designated time in the future.
	3. **Reference.** Reference systems generally take two forms: (1) topic- and area-specific storage, and (2) general reference files. The first types usually define themselves in terms of how they are stored. The second type of reference system is one that everyone needs close at hand for storing ad hoc information that doesn’t belong in some predesigned larger category.
	-  “All of your Projects, active project plans, and Next Actions, Agendas, Waiting For, and even Someday/Maybe lists should be reviewed once a week.”
5.  Your mind is for having ideas, not for holding them.
