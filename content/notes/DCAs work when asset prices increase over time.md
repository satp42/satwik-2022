# DCAs work when asset prices increase over time

[[Dollar Cost Averaging]] does improve the ROI of the investment if the asset price of the security that is being DCA'ed is increasing over time. [^1] However, DCAs do lower the cost basis of an investment, which means either the loss on an investment is lessen, or the gains on an investment is greater. This is why [[401Ks and Roth IRAs are nuanced DCA investment strategies]].
