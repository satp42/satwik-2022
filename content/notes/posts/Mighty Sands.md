Hello everybody! I’ll be talking about a trip that I went to in the summer, 2015. It was an awesome beach trip. So let’s get to it.

That day it was hard to wake up early in the morning. Because the night before the trip I watched a movie and planned to wake up late next morning. After I woke up, I realized today my friends and I were going to the trip. I got excited, but the secret part of the trip, I’ll tell you later. I rushed through all my work. Then my mom gave me a heavy turkey sandwich and told me not to rush. I did any way.

Then we went to my friend’s house to pick them up and started driving to the beach. It was 3 and half hours drive and we were getting impatient. But not to make this trip sounds such a boring one, let me tell you couple of stuffs we did while driving. Yes I know what you may be thinking, what type of music I was listening to, and it was some pop and some boring rock. Also we played a game that needed waving at people. In fact that’s the whole game. We were waving at people in nearby cars. I got to wave at 8 people and my friend did to 10.

We took a short break to use restrooms. After the break we switched the seating. When we got to the beach we ate lunch. Then we drove to the secret. And the secret was that we were going to the sand dunes. I rode on an ATV!!! An ATV is an alternative vehicle. There are automatic ATVs and manual. The ATV is just like a motorcycle. To ride an ATV you need gloves, helmet, goggles, and chest armor. These gears protect you from sand and any injury. So we rented them. We looked so rad wearing those. The cool thing was there was a real pit stop. In the beginning, I was scared. But then I finally got the hang of it. Then I got to the dunes. They were big, medium, and small. I drove the ATV almost for 2 hours. It was so much fun.

After the sand dunes we went to play some more on the beach. We played water disc and races. It was getting dark, so we wrapped up. Wait, it didn’t end there. Then we went for dinner at IHOP. Weird right? But we ate a lot. Then we headed back home and slept nicely. Now you know how great it was. You should go to Pismo Beach. Well, I have to sign out, but keep reading My Big Events.
