This is a blog post that I wrote back in 5th grade on my first website. It is about the time I won the world championships in VEX Robotics.

I am back with another post. Now from this title you expected it to be about Robotics and robots scorching each other. Well you ain’t correct. In fact I am talking about an event that happened 3 months ago. Yeah. Pretty much procrastinated, until I got reason to write it. So what is Vex Robotics. Well it is a pretty big competition that you could read about on its website… Fine I’ll tell you. Well Vex Robotics LLC, has to branches, VEX IQ, VEX EDR, and VEX PRO (for college students Vexpro is eligible as a profession, I guess). I do VEX IQ, since it is in my age as the division. Every year the Vex committee comes up with a game where you make a robot get the most points with another team, by yourself, or autonomously. From that you get awards like Design Award, Build Award, Teamwork Champion, etc.

Well we got all the way from regional to worlds. In Worlds, there are 4 divisions

-   Science
-   Technology
-   Engineering
-   Math

We got put into Science, one of the hardest divisions and 25th out of 126, and still lost. Now you might feel sad for me and leave. Buuuuuuuuut, there are still awards. We went there, put behinds on the glossy silver bleachers, and anticipated every award. Oh I forgot to tell you. There is another part of Vex IQ which is called the STEM Research Project. In this project you have to be fined a way robots are helping an industry. For months you have to research and build up a folder and a speech with a board. You can talk to sources, in which our case was with 1 enterprise and 4 other sources. You can also make an alternative. And we won that award. So I guess change that title.


Awards:

Regional: Design Award, STEM Research Project Award, Teamwork Finalist

States: Excellence Award (Best Award), Teamwork Finalist

International (Nationals was a wildcard for international): STEM RESEARCH PROJECT AWARD
