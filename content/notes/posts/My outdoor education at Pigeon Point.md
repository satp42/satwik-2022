This is a blog post I wrote when I was in 3rd grade on my first website.

On May 14th, 2015, I went to [Pigeon Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_Point_Lighthouse) along with my class for the 3rd grade outdoor trip. The first thing I did when I was in the bus was feel the paradise,since this would be the first time I would be on an overnight field trip! I was super excited !! I sat right next to my friends. After a 2 hours of bus drive we reached at the “Pigeon Point Lighthouse”. All kids were excited that they were about to explore new things. We got off, grabbed our luggage and met our tour guides, Dipper and Fiona. We played many games such as “Sharks and Minos” and “Soccer”. Then Dipper led us to the boys dorm, called “Whale”. I was lucky to be with all my friends. The dorm had 3 bunk beds, a locker full of board games, a first aid kit, and pillows. I picked the top bunk.

We got ready to go to the sea shore with the rest of the class. It was so fun! We made a beacon for the lighthouse and skipped some rocks. The extreme fun starts next, when we went to the tide pool! I touched a Hermit Crab, a Sea Anemone, many other crabs, fish, and a Yellow Slug. It was a great experience that needed a lot of courage. Then we left the animals and headed back to our cabins. At the cabin, we played some games.I was the winning champ in board games. My team also won every outdoor game. Then we had dinner. There were lots of food such as spaghetti, garlic bread, and BBQ chicken. Then we went to sleep, but Dipper said that we can play more since we were the best. So we had a pillow fight, had a NERF WAR,and did extreme stuff.

The next morning we went to the Redwoods.We saw trees of hundreds of years of age.They were so tall and had big trunks.Our teacher took us to a swamp where we saw a beaver and some squirrels. I got to kiss a Bannana Slug, it felt smooth! Then we got into the bus and headed for home.

In the bus, I closed my eyes and was thinking about the exciting experience I had in last 2 days. So many things to tell my family. I can’t wait to see them and talk about it.

I am surely looking forward to my next outdoor trip when I will be in 4th grade next year !!
