It was a bright Monday morning and I woke up really excited knowing that I was going on a school field trip to Coloma to get gold. We packed everything and went off. When I got inside the bus I knew it was going to be a long bus ride, so all I was thinking was I am going to strike it rich when I mine gold at “Coloma”. In the bus, we played a few games and later I read a story book.

After two hours, we reached Coloma. The tour guides greeted us with big miner smile and took us to the Coloma outdoor school. They told us that we were going to do a play. The play was about GOLD RUSH. Here is a quick summary about the play. There was a person named John Sutter who wanted to make an empire, so he came to America and built a big fort which is now known as Sutter’s Fort. For that he had hired James Marshall who was a carpenter and blacksmith. One day James Marshall found a gold nugget in the wood mill at Sutter’s fort. That began the famous Gold Rush. In the play, I did the role of Sam Brannon, who was one of the richest men during the Gold rush era. It was quirky doing that play!

We were getting hungry. I gulped the lunch that my mom had packed for me. After lunch, we made our gold rush pouch and each of us got a gold rush name. Mine was Satwik Tsunami. Our tour guide name was Trailblazing Tim. Tim told us that we would have corn bread for snacks. So he took us to the General Store. The sales lady, East wind Erica, helped us to get what we needed to cook corn bread. We also got our mining tools from the store.

Then we made our corn bread and went out mining at the American River. Eureka! I got some small pieces of gold. I was so happy. Then I helped some of my friends to find some gold. In the dinner, we had tacos. Later, we went to the amphitheatre and did a square dance. I danced with my friends. Then we called it a day.

The next morning, our bunk was the first one to wake up. We dashed off to the café as quick as the wind. I ate pancakes, scrambled eggs, and a chicken sausage. My friend William and I drank six cups of hot cocoa. It was like boiling fire. After breakfast we went for a hike. We saw James Marshall’s house. Tim was explaining us about Coloma Mountain. My friends Damian, Jake and I did a presentation on Coloma mountain water supply.When we reached the top of the mountain, we ate lunch. After that we started our descent. We saw a replica of Sutter’s Mill. Then we went to the Chinatown. We had a scavenger hunt. We were like old detectives trying to find the history of the Chinese Gold Rush. The artifacts in the museum were creepy, but cool. The machines and the gold rush mining tools were very fascinating.

The next day we got breakfast and most of us tried to get our last bit of the yeller color. Our tour guides taught us some mining technique and we played a mining game. After lunch at the cafeteria, we packed our stuffs and loaded the bus. We headed back home. It was 3 days without my parents, but I learned a lot in this trip.
