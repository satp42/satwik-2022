This is a blog post I wrote when I was in 6th grade on my first website. It is an ode to my room.

We all have a place that we love to stay. To some that could be a cafe, or even something as simple as a living room. But, to me I wouldn’t say that my place is as simplistic as a living room. Now something as ordinary as a bedroom, can be simple, but the inner beauty of it can really make you comprehend why it is like it is. Well from the aesthetics point of view my room isn’t much. As a eleven year old you will see over 500 books though. But, you’ll see a bed that take over 75% of my room, clothes every wear, and whiteboard put horizontally on a stool to replicate a desk, cause I don’t have one. Though I don’t see it as a place for some cat to thrive, but a place where mathematical creativity, and computational innovation can happen. A place where the room takes care of you in order to nurture your brain. A place to see laughs, and bonding with others, if you can fit them all in, and a place where I still can be what I want to be. Now I may be taunted as the every day of awakening I look to my very right to see an absence of a desk, though I’m alright because I am happy that I can adapt to any areas.
